            This has been my biggest project to date, and it took me more than 1000 lines of code to implement.
            It is my take on the popular game Battleships which was also on of the first games to be turned into a video
            game. In the project I make use of the object orientation of java. The ships, the battlefields and the
            coordinates all have their respective classes interacting with each other. Another big aspect of this
            project was the single player mode for which I came up with an algorithm which systematically imitates the
            way that I personally play the game.<br>

            <b>Technologies: </b>Shortest Path Problem, Digraphs, Java<br>
            <br>
            This project was created for a university assignment for the shortest path problem. The basic framework for
            this project was given to me. During rescaling, the algorithm tries to find the path of pixels through the
            image with the least contrast. Removing these pixels would result in the smallest loss of information. This
            is repeated until the desired width is reached. The image is modeled as an acyclic, weighted, directed grid
            graph. The weight of the pixels to other pixels is determined by their contrast and the search is done
            through a topological algorithm.

            This was another big project which I took on during my internship at KPMG as a software developer. It was
            a project for the test automation of a client website which KPMG developed. The website was a tool for
            business travels to assess the risks and need for different requirements like social security and tax.
            I worked with other software developers and developed the project according to the requirements of the tax
            team. For Testing the assessments and functionality I used the ROBOT Framework with some python scripting.
            Sadly I cannot share any of the source code in a Git repository.

            <b>Technologies: </b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
            <br>
            I love to play the piano in my free time. That is why I thought it would be fun to develop a web page which
            is just that. A piano. <br>
            This is a project to first get introduced to front-end development. I used CSS to design the piano properly
            and JavaScript to work with the input from the keyboard. <br>
            <br>
            You can try it out yourself. Click

            <br>
            This web scraper uses BeautifulSoup and the Python request library in order to get and parse the HTML code
            of a website called nature.com. It takes the user input about the topic and number of pages which the
            scraper will go through to find articles about the given topics. In the end, you will have different files
            with the text from the articles of the given topic.<br>

            <br>
            My biggest front-end project is this web page. I programmed it from scratch, worked with color combinations,
            flexbox, navigation, different page layouts, means of interactiveness and other front-end technologies.
            <br>
            For preparation, I did a front-end course on hyperskill. That way, I go a better understanding of HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript and general front-end development fundamentals.<br>
