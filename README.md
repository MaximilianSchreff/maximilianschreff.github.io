# Portfolio Page

My biggest front-end project is this web page. I programmed it from scratch, worked with color combinations,
flexbox, navigation, different page layouts, means of interactiveness and other front-end technologies.
For preparation, I did a front-end course on hyperskill. That way, I go a better understanding of HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and general front-end development fundamentals.
